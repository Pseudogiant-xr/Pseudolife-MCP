# PseudoLife-MCP — project conventions

Conventions that aren't derivable from a quick read of the code. Follow them
exactly; they exist because each one was violated at least once.

## Shipping checklist (any change that lands on master)

1. **CHANGELOG.md entry under `[Unreleased]`** — every behavior, schema, or
   perf change gets one, in the existing dated-subsection style. Docs-only and
   test-only changes are exempt.
2. **Schema bumps** touch four places together: `SCHEMA_META_VERSION` in
   `pseudolife_memory/storage/schema.py`, the two README mentions (capabilities
   table + DSN row — pinned by `tests/test_release_ux.py`), the version-pin
   tests (`test_schema_v13.py`, `test_schema_v16.py`, `test_temporal_stamp.py`,
   plus a new `test_schema_vNN.py` for the addition itself), and a CHANGELOG
   mention of `vNN` (pinned by `test_release_ux.py`).
3. **Full suite before commit** — `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1 python -m pytest tests/`
   with the bench Postgres up (127.0.0.1:5433); PG-backed tests skip silently
   without it, which is not a pass.
4. **Deploy only via `ops/update.ps1`** (backup → rollback tag → daemon-only
   `--no-deps` rebuild → health). Never `docker compose down -v` — the bank
   volumes are external precisely so that this is survivable, but don't test it.
5. **After deploy, verify live**, not just `/health`: exercise the changed path
   through the daemon (an MCP call, a psql check of new DDL).

## Derived state / caches / indexes

When adding any derived structure over mutable state (an index over band
entries, a cached view of the graph, a memoized score):

- **Enumerate every mutation path first**, including the ones that bypass the
  normal write API: `hydrate_cms` / `load()` / legacy migration append to
  `band.entries` directly and never call `store()`. Grep for the state being
  mutated, not for the API you expect callers to use.
- **State the real workload's read/write interleave and check the maintenance
  policy preserves the win under it.** The daemon's steady state is
  store/search alternation: an invalidate-on-every-write policy rebuilds on
  every read and silently degrades to the cost you were optimizing away.
  Extend-in-place for additions; rebuild only on removals/replacement.
- **List what the replaced code provided implicitly** — iteration order
  (tie-break determinism), containment semantics (`bands=` filters on the band
  that holds the entry, not `entry.bank`, which goes stale across preset
  changes), live-object reads (supersession flags are read at query time).
  Preserve each one or change it consciously and say so in the commit.

## Review discipline

- Perf/cache/index changes get an independent review pass before commit
  (`/code-review` medium, or a reviewer subagent) — the 2026-07-12 slot-index
  audit found three of these classes post-deploy; the pass is cheaper.
- TDD with a watched RED per the superpowers skill; for invalidation contracts,
  spot-check that each hook is load-bearing by disabling it and confirming the
  test goes red (a hook that never fires red is decoration, and worth saying so).

## Repo hygiene — no PII, ever (public repo)

Anything pushed is public forever: GitHub keeps merged-PR commits reachable
via `refs/pull/*`, which owners cannot purge (Support ticket only) — one
leaked email already cost a full history rewrite plus a fresh-repo publish.

- **Never commit PII or machine identifiers**: emails, OS usernames
  (`C:\Users\<real name>`), hostnames, LAN IPs/subnets, tokens/keys. Docs and
  tests use placeholders (`<user>`, `example.com`) or the synthetic `10.0.0.x`
  examples already in the tree.
- **Extend the guard, don't just scrub**: a removal without a test regresses
  (2026-07-12 lesson). Any newly-spotted identifier class gets added to
  `tests/test_release_ux.py::test_tracked_tree_carries_no_maintainer_identifiers`
  with a watched RED before the scrub.
- **Commit identity stays the GitHub noreply address**
  (`Pseudogiant-xr@users.noreply.github.com`); tee'd script output
  (`deploy-*.log` etc.) stays out of the tree — it embeds absolute home paths.
- **Commit METADATA is a leak channel the guard test can't see**: GitHub
  web-UI edits stamp the account's real email unless Settings → Emails →
  "Keep my email addresses private" is ON (verified on, 2026-07-16 — it was
  off, and one web edit leaked; inspect any unexpected remote commit with
  `git show --format=%ae` before building on it).
- **If a real secret ever lands in a pushed commit: rotate it first.** A
  rewrite is tidiness, not remediation.

## Memory (PseudoLife MCP tools)

Log `memory_outcome` at task end — success/failure/correction signals are the
only feeder for the lessons surfaced at session start. Deploys and eval results
get a `memory_store` with source `pseudolife-mcp` (status chatter →
`source="status"`).
