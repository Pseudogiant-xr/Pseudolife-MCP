# Benchmarks

What the memory actually buys, measured. Part of the
[user guide](../../README.md#documentation); the full methodology and every
finding live in [`evals/README.md`](../../evals/README.md).

## LongMemEval — knowledge updates

Measured on the **knowledge-update subset of
[LongMemEval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10813)** (78 questions) — the
"user's facts change over time" ability the HLC supersession spine exists
for. Everything local: extraction, answering, and LLM-as-judge grading all
run on the author's own hardware (judge = Qwen3.6-27B at temperature 0),
so compare *within* the table, not against GPT-4o-judged leaderboards.

On the oracle variant (evidence sessions only), with the local-ceiling
extractor:

| arm | accuracy | context tokens/question |
|-----|----------|------------------------|
| naive RAG (top-6 turns) | 0.615 | 1638 |
| cortex facts only | 0.564 | **59** |
| **hybrid (facts + top-3 turns)** | **0.705** | 979 |

The consolidated-facts posture beats naive RAG by 9 points while reading
~40% of the context — and the fact spine alone delivers 92% of RAG's
accuracy on **3.6% of its token budget**.

## Extraction quality is the dominant factor

Running floor (Gemma 4 E2B, the smallest CPU-sidecar bake) vs ceiling
(Qwen3.6-27B) extractors with the RAG arm as a fixed control isolates
**extraction quality as the dominant factor** in fact-spine accuracy — the
measured case for upgrading the extractor when you have local compute to
spare (see [Dreaming — upgrading the extractor](dreaming.md#upgrading-the-extractor--bigger-local-models)).
Even the smallest bake beats naive-RAG at ~25× fewer tokens/query.

The harder full-haystack (`_s`) results, the extractor-ladder screen used
to choose the default sidecar model, and the abstention-calibration sweep
are all in [`evals/README.md`](../../evals/README.md).
