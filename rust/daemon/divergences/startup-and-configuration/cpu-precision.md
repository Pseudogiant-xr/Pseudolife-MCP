| Item | Python | Rust | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| CPU precision | `auto` uses bf16 torch on bf16-native CPUs; explicit bf16 is honored by torch | `auto` selects the graph's fp32 policy; effective explicit bf16 refuses with `deferred: bf16 ONNX` | parity evidence pins fp32; automatic and explicit bf16 ONNX remain deferred |
