| Item | Python | Rust | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hub cache override interpolation | Python expands `~` and environment variables in cache paths | HF_HOME, HF_HUB_CACHE and XDG_CACHE_HOME must already contain expanded paths | interpolation spellings are deferred; ordinary absolute/relative paths and override precedence are supported |
